# JUCE + CMake Tutorial Repo

This repository is intended to serve as a collection of projects built with CMake from following the official JUCE tutorials.

Builds can be found in each program's 'Builds' folder. If you would like to explore the projects yourself, keep in mind that these projects are looking for the JUCE root directory in their respective 'Ext' folders.

JUCE can be found here:
